# minehash
A simple program for extracting Minecraft's files.

I created this when I thought the process of finding the hashed files in the AppData folder could be
simplified.


First, the user will be prompted for the desired json file found under <.minecraft/assets/indexes>.

Then it prompts for the phrase to search for. (for instance, <minecraft/sounds/music/> would extract all files indexed under that location, and <minecraft/sounds/music/menu/menu2.ogg> would extract <menu2.ogg>)

Then it prompts for the file extension to give the files.

Then it prompts for the location you want to copy your files to.
